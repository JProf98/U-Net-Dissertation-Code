# U-Net-Dissertation-Code
This is the code used for the dissertation project.

To create the other models discussed within the project, change the convolutional filter size for each double convolutional filter within the convolutional layers
To change the solver, simply change the solver name from SGD to adam
To change the loss function, change the loss function to binary_crossentropy or mean_squared_error
